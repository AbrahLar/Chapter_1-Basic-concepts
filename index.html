    <h1>Basic concepts</h1>
    <p>
        An <b>electric circuit</b> is an interconnection of electrical elements.
    </p>
    <h2>Charge and current</h2>
    <p> 
        <b>Charge</b> is an electrical property of the atomic particles of which mater consists,
        mesuared in coulumbs \((\pu{C})\).<br>
        The following points should be noted about electric charge:
        <ol>
            <li>
                We know that the charge \(\pu{e}\) on an electron is negative \(\pu{1 e} \approx
                \pu{-1.602 \times 10^{-19} C}\). In \(\pu{-1 C}\) of charge, there are
                approximately \(6.242 \times 10^{18}\) electrons.
            </li>
            <li>
                The only charges that occur in nature are integral multiples of the electron
                charge.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <em>law of conservation of charge</em> states that charge can neither be
                created nor destroyed, only transferred.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Electric current</b> is the time rate of change of charge, mesuered in amperes
        \((\pu{A}\)).<br>
        Mathematically the relationship between current, charge and time is: 
        $$ i \overset{\Delta}{=} \frac{\mathrm{d} q}{\mathrm{d} t} $$
        The charge transferred between time \(t_{0}\) and \(t\) is obtained by integrating the
        current:
        $$ Q \overset{\Delta}{=} \int _{t_{0}} ^{t} i \ \mathrm{d} t $$
        Where:<br>
        \(i\) is the current \((\pu{A})\).<br>
        \(q\) is the charge \((\pu{C})\).<br>
        \(t\) and \(t_{0}\) are a specific times \((\pu{s})\)
    </p>
    <p>
        It is conventional to take the current flow as the movement of positive charges. That is,
        opposite to the flow of negative charges.
    </p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;">Image 1</p>
    <p>
        A <b>direct current</b> (dc) \((I)\) is a current that remains constant with time.
    </p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;">Image 2</p>
    <p>
        An <b>alternating current</b> (ac) \((i)\) is a current that varies sinusoidally with time.
    </p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;">Image 3</p>
    <h2>Voltage</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Voltage</b> (or potential difference) is the energy required to move a unit charge
        through an element, measured in volts \((\pu{V})\).
        $$ v_{ab} \overset{\Delta}{=} \frac{\mathrm{d} w}{\mathrm{d} q} $$
        Where:<br>
        \(v_{ab}\) is the voltage between the points \(a\) and \(b\) \((\pu{V})\).<br>
        \(w\) is the energy requiered \((\pu{J})\).<br>
        \(q\) is the charge \((\pu{C})\).
    </p>
    <p>
        The potential at point \(a\) with respect to point \(b\) is \(v_{ab}\). In general:
        $$ v_{ab} = -v_{ba} $$
    </p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;">Image 4</p>
    <p>
        Like electric current, a constant voltage is called a dc voltage \((V)\), whereas a
        sinusoidally time-varying voltage is called an ac voltage \((v)\).
    </p>
    <h2>Power and energy</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Power</b> is the time rate of expending or absorbing energy, measured in watts
        \((\mathrm{W})\).
        $$ p \overset{\Delta}{=} \frac{\mathrm{d} w}{\mathrm{d} t} $$
        Where:<br>
        \(p\) is the power \((\pu{W})\).<br>
        \(w\) is energy \((\pu{J})\).<br>
        \(t\) is the time \((\pu{s})\).<br>
        Or
        $$ p = vi $$
        If \(p > 0\), power is being absorbed by the element. If, on the other hand, \(p < 0\),
        power is being supplied by the
        element.<br>
        The sum of power in a circuit, at any instant of time, must be zero.
        $$ \sum p = 0 $$
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Energy</b> is the capacity to do work, measured in joules \((\pu{J})\).<br>
        The energy absorbed or supplied by an element from time \(t_{0}\) to time \(t\) is:
        $$ w = \int _{t_{0}} ^{t} p \ \mathrm{d} t $$
        The electric power utility companies measure energy in watt-hours \((\pu{W*h})\).
        \(\pu{1 W*h = \pu{3,600 J}}\).
    </p>

    <h2>Circuit elements</h2>
    <p>
        An <em>active element</em> is capable of generating energy while a <em>passive element</em>
        is not.<br>
        An ideal <b>independent source</b> is an active element that provides aspecified voltage or
        current that is completely independent of other circuit elements.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;">Image 6</p>
    <p>
        An ideal <b>dependent</b> (or controlled) <b>source</b> is an active element in which the
        source quantity is controlled by another voltage or current.
